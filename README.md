# Protein-Classification-Using-GCN-and-GIN
This project performs graph classification to determine whether a protein structure (represented as a graph) corresponds to an enzyme or non-enzyme. It leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and explores data augmentation using Cayley Graph Propagation.
